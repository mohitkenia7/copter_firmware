    // Stardard PPM details:
    //
    //   A single PPMSum frame comes in short, fixed length impulses (~100 us)
    //   and variable length gaps (~1000-2000 us) between them, coding the
    //   actual value of each channel. Impulses come before first channel gap,
    //   between channel gaps and after last channel gap as well (so 8 channels
    //   have 9 impulses in a frame).
    //
    //   To increase temporal resolution, the channel value is coded in the sum
    //   of the impulse length and the gap before or after it, depending on
    //   whether the first detected signal is a falling or rising edge.
    //
    //   If it is falling, width_s0 will contain actual gap and width_s1 will
    //   contain the impulse length after it. If it is rising, width_s0 will
    //   contain the impulse length and width_s1 will contain the gap after it.
    //
    //   This function should work equally for both cases.
    //
    //   A major problem with PPMSum is when all channel values are high, the
    //   typically larger gap (~>2300 us) between frames becomes so small that
    //   it gets indistinguishable from further channel values.
    //
    // Notes for Collmot's hacked FrSky v8R7II -> PPMSum receivers:
    //
    //   In our receivers impulse length is around 90-100 us before all channels
    //   and 32 us after the 8th channel. This shows the end of the frame.
    //
    //   frames come at 18ms, so main frequency is 55.5 Hz
    //
    //   max data length within a frame is thus approximately
    //   8 * 2000us + 8 * 100us + 32us = 16832 us,
    //   so only 1168 us is left until next frame if channel values are high,
    //   So detection of 32us pulse is critical!!!
